# pyTrackers
This repository contains implementation of some major correlation filter based trackers cloned from [pyCFTrackers](https://github.com/fengyang95/pyCFTrackers) repo and some deep learning trackers taken from [pytracking](https://github.com/fengyang95/pyCFTrackers). Modifications of their algorithms are made so that they can be benefit from camera state mesurements. The algorithms are evaluated on a custom dataset named [VIOT dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xYHGJR-UWccPzbIuzMU_yf0bSkQ42qQh/view?usp=sharing). For running the codes please use the Google Colab notebook found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wTrGJHloQL1AI5cFKk6k7yxKirEFmMDs?usp=sharing).
